</h2>
			<p>She was wearing a panama, and she carried a sketching-block and camp-stool.</p>
			<p>"Good evening," I said.</p>
			<p>"Good evening," said she.</p>
			<p>It is curious how different the same words can sound, when spoken by different people. My "good evening" might have been that of a man with a particularly guilty conscience caught in the act of doing something more than usually ignoble. She spoke like a rather offended angel.</p>
			<p>"It's a lovely evening," I went on pluckily.</p>
			<p>"Very."</p>
			<p>"The sunset!"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"Er—"</p>
			<p>She raised a pair of blue eyes, devoid of all expression save a faint suggestion of surprise, and gazed through me for a moment at some object a couple of thousand miles away, and lowered them again, leaving me with a vague feeling that there was something wrong with my personal appearance.</p>
			<p>Very calmly she moved to the edge of the cliff, arranged her camp-stool, and sat down. Neither of us spoke a word. I watched her while she filled a little mug with water from a little bottle, opened her paint-box, selected a brush, and placed her sketching-block in position.</p>
			<p>She began to paint.</p>
			<p>Now, by all the laws of good taste, I should before this have made a dignified exit. It was plain that I was not to be regarded as an essential ornament of this portion of the Ware Cliff. By now, if I had been the Perfect Gentleman, I ought to have been a quarter of a mile away.</p>
			<p>But there is a definite limit to what a man can do. I remained.</p>
			<p>The sinking sun flung a carpet of gold across the sea. Phyllis' hair was tinged with it. Little waves tumbled lazily on the beach below. Except for the song of a distant blackbird, running through its repertoire before retiring for the night, everything was silent.</p>
			<p>She sat there, dipping and painting and dipping again, with never a word for me—standing patiently and humbly behind her.</p>
			<p>"Miss Derrick," I said.</p>
			<p>She half turned her head.</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"Why won't you speak to me?" I said.</p>
			<p>"I don't understand you."</p>
			<p>"Why won't you speak to me?"</p>
			<p>"I think you know, Mr. Garnet."</p>
			<p>"It is because of that boat accident?"</p>
			<p>"Accident!"</p>
			<p>"Episode," I amended.</p>
			<p>She went on painting in silence. From where I stood I could see her profile. Her chin was tilted. Her expression was determined.</p>
			<p>"Is it?" I said.</p>
			<p>"Need we discuss it?"</p>
			<p>"Not if you do not wish it."</p>
			<p>I paused.</p>
			<p>"But," I added, "I should have liked a chance to defend myself.... What glorious sunsets there have been these last few days. I believe we shall have this sort of weather for another month."</p>
			<p>"I should not have thought that possible."</p>
			<p>"The glass is going up," I said.</p>
			<p>"I was not talking about the weather."</p>
			<p>"It was dull of me to introduce such a worn-out topic."</p>
			<p>"You said you could defend yourself."</p>
			<p>"I said I should like the chance to do so."</p>
			<p>"You have it."</p>
			<p>"That's very kind of you. Thank you."</p>
			<p>"Is there any reason for gratitude?"</p>
			<p>"Every reason."</p>
			<p>"Go on, Mr. Garnet. I can listen while I paint. But please sit down. I don't like being talked to from a height."</p>
			<p>I sat down on the grass in front of her, feeling as I did so that the change of position in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground. Instinctively I avoided eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading. Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.</p>
			<p>"You remember, of course, the night you and Professor Derrick dined with us? When I say dined, I use the word in a loose sense."</p>
			<p>For a moment I thought she was going to smile. We were both thinking of Edwin. But it was only for a moment, and then her face grew cold once more, and the chin resumed its angle of determination.</p>
			<p>"Yes," she said.</p>
			<p>"You remember the unfortunate ending of the festivities?"</p>
			<p>"Well?"</p>
			<p>"If you recall that at all clearly, you will also remember that the fault was not mine, but Ukridge's."</p>
			<p>"Well?"</p>
			<p>"It was his behaviour that annoyed Professor Derrick. The position, then, was this, that I was to be cut off from the pleasantest friendship I had ever formed——"</p>
			<p>I stopped for a moment. She bent a little lower over her easel, but remained silent.</p>
			<p>"——Simply through the tactlessness of a prize idiot."</p>
			<p>"I like Mr. Ukridge."</p>
			<p>"I like him, too. But I can't pretend that he is anything but an idiot at times."</p>
			<p>"Well?"</p>
			<p>"I naturally wished to mend matters. It occurred to me that an excellent way would be by doing your father a service. It was seeing him fishing that put the idea of a boat-accident into my head. I hoped for a genuine boat-accident. But those things only happen when one does not want them. So I determined to engineer one."</p>
			<p>"You didn't think of the shock to my father."</p>
			<p>"I did. It worried me very much."</p>
			<p>"But you upset him all the same."</p>
			<p>"Reluctantly."</p>
			<p>She looked up, and our eyes met. I could detect no trace of forgiveness in hers.</p>
			<p>"You behaved abominably," she said.</p>
			<p>"I played a risky game, and I lost. And I shall now take the consequences. With luck I should have won. I did not have luck, and I am not going to grumble about it. But I am grateful to you for letting me explain. I should not have liked you to have gone on thinking that I played practical jokes on my friends. That is all I have to say. I think it was kind of you to listen. Good-bye, Miss Derrick."</p>
			<p>I got up.</p>
			<p>"Are you going?"</p>
			<p>"Why not?"</p>
			<p>"Please sit down again."</p>
			<p>"But you wish to be alone——"</p>
			<p>"Please sit down!"</p>
			<p>There was a flush on the cheek turned towards me, and the chin was tilted higher.</p>
			<p>I sat down.</p>
			<p>To westward the sky had changed to the hue of a bruised cherry. The sun had sunk below the horizon, and the sea looked cold and leaden. The blackbird had long since flown.</p>
			<p>"I am glad you told me, Mr. Garnet."</p>
			<p>She dipped her brush in the water.</p>
			<p>"Because I don't like to think badly of—people."</p>
			<p>She bent her head over her painting.</p>
			<p>"Though I still think you behaved very wrongly. And I am afraid my father will never forgive you for what you did."</p>
			<p>Her father! As if he counted.</p>
			<p>"But you do?" I said eagerly.</p>
			<p>"I think you are less to blame than I thought you were at first."</p>
			<p>"No more than that?"</p>
			<p>"You can't expect to escape all consequences. You did a very stupid thing."</p>
			<p>"I was tempted."</p>
			<p>The sky was a dull grey now. It was growing dusk. The grass on which I sat was wet with dew.</p>
			<p>I stood up.</p>
			<p>"Isn't it getting a little dark for painting?" I said. "Are you sure you won't catch cold? It's very damp."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps it is. And it is late, too."</p>
			<p>She shut her paint-box, and emptied the little mug on to the grass.</p>
			<p>"May I carry your things?" I said.</p>
			<p>I think she hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>
			<p>I possessed myself of the camp-stool, and we started on our homeward journey.</p>
			<p>We were both silent. The spell of the quiet summer evening was on us.</p>
			<p>"'And all the air a solemn stillness holds,'" she said softly. "I love this cliff, Mr. Garnet. It's the most soothing place in the world."</p>
			<p>"I found it so this evening."</p>
			<p>She glanced at me quickly.</p>
			<p>"You're not looking well," she said. "Are you sure you are not overworking yourself?"</p>
			<p>"No, it's not that."</p>
			<p>Somehow we had stopped, as if by agreement, and were facing each other. There was a look in her eyes I had never seen there before. The twilight hung like a curtain between us and the world. We were alone together in a world of our own.</p>
			<p>"It is because I had offended you," I said.</p>
			<p>She laughed a high, unnatural laugh.</p>
			<p>"I have loved you ever since I first saw you," I said doggedly.</p>
